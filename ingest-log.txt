    transcript: "video. So I slept not bad. I listened to Vallis by PKD while I was sleeping and I had some pretty kooky dreams. Some pretty kooky ones about I was in like a train, I was in a train with the characters with my imagination of the characters from the from the thing. And I don't know man. It's written in this very like 70s. aimless drugged up American style. That's very atheist and hopeless and and the book even begins with uh a long narrative about suicide. one of the characters kills themselves. The main character talks about being suicidal a couple years in the future. And then I fell asleep. And then there were some religious themes to the whole deal. like I think I was sitting at a table being religiously served chocolate milk at a setting that I'm familiar with. I don't know exactly where. Maybe it was the babysitter's house that I used to go to. But I think it's cool how I can I can have strange dreams like that in the morning. As I'm waking up. Where there's a book playing like that. It happens a lot. But it has to be novel content. If I've heard it before, I don't think I get the same dreaming effect.",

    summary: 'The video shows someone playing League of Legends while simultaneously working on coding a user interface for American law. The presenter discusses how he procrastinates from working on his user interface code by playing League of Legends, but then pivots to actually working on the user interface. He clones his American law git repository, inspects the code and notes that it loads too many entries per page, which causes the user interface to be slow. The user closes the League of Legends interface and begins to focus on the code',
    transcript: "So, now we have uh me playing another game of League of Legends because this is what I do to feel productive. When I'm not actually being productive, I'm procrastinating. What I should be doing right now is shipping a game. Uh not a game, a a user interface for the law called American law. And so why not get that started right now while I'm waiting for the game to start. It's not the best idea but it's not a terrible idea. Um I think that's the wrong one. Is not American Law. Yeah, no it's the right one. And so the reason I haven't touched this is because it works. It doesn't work well, it's not usable by anyone but the logic is all established for the um the thing that it needs to do. So it's going to grab stuff from the code base and from the data set. And it's going to it's going to load like 945 items to one page which is not great. But uh that makes it slow. So one of the things that needs to be changed is that uh it needs to be made not so slow. But first I have to start a new branch.",

Um, and then all I've been doing is basically playing League of Legends and talking with um, this system about itself. So here we have our returned videos and at the top are the most relevant ones. Um, so this is maybe not the most interesting one. It's uh populating a message and then we can watch the video. This is the memory manager bot controller deal. I have tried to do my best. Um, to get everything working in a in a way that yep, so we've got the um automated tags and insights that are relevant to the video generated by Gemini and then we can have like a conversation about it. And I'm not sure why we're still debugging here. We've got two the same. Uh we got two calls that are coming back, but uh What do we say here? Okay. Um, But yeah, anyways, like this is the only thing that I've been uh showing videos this is the only thing I've been recording videos about, so this is what it talks about.

And uh, we're going to test out a feature that is going to look over all of the um, memories that have been recorded since I started this beast on the 23rd of March. And I'm going to ask it about um, making a video for my audience on X.com, the everything app, and I wanted it to pull up some content that they would find interesting. So we're going to see what happens and while we wait for the videos to be sent to Gemini 2.0 flash, uh all of their summaries are being sent in several different API calls. I'm sure there's a more efficient, less expensive way of doing that, but for simplicity at the moment, that's how we're going to do it. Once that finishes, we're going to have a list of most relevant videos that we can click on and then have a conversation with. So, um, don't read this. It's the first thing that I said to this system and um, it was just a testing thing. Um, and then all I've been doing is basically playing League of Legends and talking with um, this system about itself. So here we have our returned videos and at the top are the most relevant ones. Um, so this is maybe not the most interesting one. It's uh populating a message and then we can watch the video. This is the memory manager bot controller deal. I have tried to do my best. Um, to get everything working in a in a way that yep, so we've got the um automated tags and insights that are relevant to the video generated by Gemini and then we can have like a conversation about it. And I'm not sure why we're still debugging here. We've got two the same. Uh we got two calls that are coming back, but uh What do we say here? Okay. Um, But yeah, anyways, like this is the only thing that I've been uh showing videos this is the only thing I've been recording videos about, so this is what it talks about. And then we can, you know, send messages here. Wow. Cool. Thank you.",

    transcript: "Okay, well, it seems like everything is gelling now. System is a go. And I am going to just talk about something other than the system itself because that's just what I do. I do things other than talk about the memory system that I've built with you and other large language models. So, here's the thing, I'm gay. No, I'm just kidding. Not actually gay. I am, uh, what am I? I'm excited. I'm excited for this opportunity to start building things with, um, with you and with me and with everybody, everybody will be happy together, and we will do things like, um, playing the video games and building the codes and doing other things together. So, what's on the docket, right? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. But these are people who are doing things together. So, um, this is our notes page. What else? Um, insert cover image, upload from computer. Yeah, I don't know. I think we for sure have good stuff coming to us in the future. But I need to get clear on the stuff that I want to make here because I've made a bunch of stuff and it's all sort of disjointed and, uh, garbuly gooked. So.",
